Fasted-state gastrointestinal (GI) fluid transit is typically represented as a first-order, 
deterministic process (averaged and viewed as a continuous approximation). It is, however, 
most likely a discrete process involving fluid packets interrupted by variable time periods of 
little to no fluid emptying.

A novel, stochastic process was developed describing cyclical fasted-state gastrointestinal motility and how GI contents are propelled in discrete fluid pockets based on motility phase. The migrating motor complex (MMC) is described as before relative to the time of dosing using a Fourier series approximation while a non-homogenous Poisson process is used to capture the inter-pulse timings. Two random processes control fluid transit: the volume of the random fluid packet formed, and the time the fluid packet pulses out of the compartment. Since a Poisson process is used, the pulsing of fluid packets is memory-less and determined by the parameter Î»(t) which evolves with the MMC. The volumetric effect is also taken into account, where a larger fluid volume induces distension and is release more rapidly than a smaller volume. Since this is a stochastic model, many samples must be drawn to glean appropriate statistics.
